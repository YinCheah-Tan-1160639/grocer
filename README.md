# Fresh Harvest Grocer Ordering App

This is a software design and development project. The project follows object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and uses MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture for its structure. 

In this project, I learn to:

1. Design model classes 
2. Use SQLAlchemy (Object Relational Mapper, ORM) to store the objects to MySQL database. 
3. Generate program documentation using Doxygen.
4. Error handling
